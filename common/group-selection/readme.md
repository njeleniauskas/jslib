# Group Selection
Common functions to handle groups with single or multi-selection.

<br>


## Overview
The group selection module manages the selection of controls within a component. There are a few important behaviors this module covers, including behaviors for

<br>

- single selection;
- multiple selection;
- resetting a group;
- toggling a reset control; and 
- managing the statedness of controls.

<br> 

## Behavior and Usage
### Updating a Selection
Because of the flexibility, updating a selection group is accomplished by using the `updateGroupSelection` function, which requires the nodes, callback function, and arguments for the function to work. The callback will either be the `updateSingleSelection` or `updateMultipleSelection` functions.

### Reset Features
Resetting a selection group is useful when one or more selections are possible. In this case, functions exist to help reset the selection group to its initial state, and toggle the reset control.

Toggling a reset control flags the element with an attribute and a class in case authors wish to dynamically show the control. Note that the attribute controls visibility, and the class transitioning.

In addition, when toggling by attribute value, resetting needs to know if being visible is truthy or falsy.

### Control Statedness
The functions in this module cover any type of accessible stated-ness that can exist, including the state being represented by

<br>

- the value of an attribute;
- the existence of an attribute; or event
- the checked state of radio and checkbox inputs.

Authors can be very specific about what component accept, or allow any type of selection.
