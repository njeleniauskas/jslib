# Focus Trapping
Helper functions to help users trap focus in a specific context.

<br>

## Overview
Focus trapping can be done in one of two ways: by actively passing focus between boundary elements in a specific parent element, or by disabling focus on every interactive element outside that specific parent element.

At present, only active passing functions exist to help collection and return the first and last interactive elements within a specific DOM node.

## Roadmap
- Explore focus trapping by using the `inert` attribute.
