## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help authors build modern, accessible products quickly and easily in a no-dependency environment. It's designed around the goal of separating functionalities into discrete packages, and structured into three types of modules/functions that help with these different needs.

<br>

- **Specific Module**:
Specific modules represent individual components or features. These are the most complete packages in the library and commonly include other modules/functions from this library to work properly.

- **Common Modules**:
Common modules provide discete functionalities as a package â€” for example, navigating a composite element (like a tab component). They do not work on their own, but help to provide specific needs for a given component/feature.

- **Utility Functions**:
Utility functions handle highly specific situations, and are too small/universal to be included in a module.
